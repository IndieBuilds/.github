## What is IndieBuilds? 🤔

IndieBuilds is a marketplace (A game storefront) for indie game developers to publish and sell their games.

## The Mission and Vision! 🫡

The mission and vision of IndieBuilds is to provide a marketplace where indie game developers can sell their games to their auidence.

The types of games allowed on IndieBuilds meets no bounds. Games can range from all sorts of projects such as

- Free to Play (FTP) demos and games.
- Commercial games sold for 💸.
- Demos of commercial or Free to Play games

IndieBuilds was created to enable independent game developers the ability to sell their games, reach a wider audience and help them earn a living so they can keep doing what they love <em>(Hint: It involves games.)</em>

## Why another Game Store front? 🧐

Simple! 🙂 Here are 3 reasons why.

<ol>
    <li>
        If you are an independent game developer on a budget then having your game on another market place to sell your game and find your audience is a huge plus.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        IndieBuilds payouts 💰 are larger you get to keep 85% of the sale. 10% of that 85% is invested on your behalf so you can earn based off of that one sale forever. (Or at least until a meteor ☄️ hit the Earth 🌎)
    </li>
</ol>
